# BitLondonBuild

I developed Bit London as an educational game with the intention of creating an informative and engaging point-and-click adventure. The game is specifically designed to be played on a touch screen, making it suitable for in-flight entertainment on airplanes. Its main purpose is to provide tourists with a pre-exploration experience of their travel destination.
